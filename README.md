 # Chris Nicholls CV

### Improbable
##### May 2013 - Present

I have been working at Improbable more or less since the company started, and as such I have had many different roles here.
Improbable builds SpatialOS, a distributed simulation platform for games.

My work here has covered:
* Distributed systems development
* Simulation
* Gameplay programming
* Managing a team
* R&D
* Technical Account Management
* Interviewing
* Pitching to investors
* Sales and pitching to customers

And many other things.

Most recently, I have been leading the Production Research team.
The aim of the team is to probe the boundaries of SpatialOS; to understand exactly what it can and can't do and back up our understanding with real data.

### GSA Capital
##### Sep 2011 -> Jan 2013

During my time at GSA Capital, a high-frequency systematic hedge fund, I worked in two of the core research technology
teams: the execution group responsible for the technology behind executing the orders, and the data services group.
My work was broad-ranging, largely focused on improving robustness and availability of the internal systems, and ensuring that the data we provided researchers is consistent.
Most of the production development was either Java or Python, while much of my non-production testing and
analysis done in with Haskell.

### Detica
##### Sep 2010 -> Sep 2011
While at Detica, I worked on automatic insurance fraud detection using network analysis of large data sets.

My role was largely that of a Java developer, integrating a new data-scoring tool into our model.
I spent some time working on our in-house compiler, a SAS-like language called DataServer.
As well as development, I was also involved in the pre-sales team, taking on a more client-facing role.

### Oxford University
#### MSC Math & Computer Science - 1st class

I was awarded a first class masters degree in Mathematics and Computer science from the University of Oxford. My course
focused on algorithm design, compilers and programming languages, functional programming, linear algebra and topology.

During my time at Oxford, I was awarded a number of prizes for my work:

• My final year thesis, entitled “Using Linearity to Allow Heap Recycling in Haskell”, earned me the prize for best fourth year
computer science project. The project involved designing and implementing an extension to the the type system and
optimization model of the industry-standard Haskell compiler GHC, based on an new form of uniqueness analysis for higher-
order programs.

• In the same year, Somerville college gave me the ‘Mary Somerville’ prize for exam performance.

• During my first and second year a programming competition open to all undergraduates was held in which I came second in my
first year and came first in my second year.

• My tutors awarded me a college prize for my effort and progress during my second year.


### Skills and Technologies

I like to think of my skills as transferable and agnostic from any particular technology.
I enjoy learning new domains, and I am happy developing in a wide variety of languages and frameworks where necessary
That being said, I have development experience with the following languages: **Java, C#, Scala, Haskell, Python, Javascript,** and a few others here and there.
